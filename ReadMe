This project runs a Calculator object which supports parenthetical expressions, factorials, 
powers, arithmetic expressions, trigonometric expressions, and logarithms. 

To use the Calculator, run the HasMain class under runProgram.  

The BrainInterface (in the "brain" package) may be regressed by running the TestBrain class, 
located in the "test" package. This class contains data-driven TestNG tests which pull data
from an Excel file located in the Data folder. 

IMPORTANT: TestNG tests require that TestNG and/or the TestNG plugin for Eclipse be installed.
Additionally, the class MyExcelReader, located in the "data" package, requires that all 
necessary poi .jar files be included. They can be downloaded from https://poi.apache.org/download.html
and added to the project as external jar files.
